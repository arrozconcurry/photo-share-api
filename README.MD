PhotoShare API
===============
PhotoShare is the main back-end exercise for [GraphQL Workshop](https://www.graphqlworkshop.com). In this exercise, students build a GraphQL API for a small photo sharing application.

Changes
---------------
Within the data folder you will find sample json data for __Users__. You'll need to create types to match the data found in this file. Then, we need to add the necessary queries and resolvers to make the user data accessible with our GraphQL Service.

### Goals

* [ ] Ability to Query the __totalUsers__ count
* [ ] Ability to Query __allUsers__ records
* [ ] Ability to Query an individual __User__
